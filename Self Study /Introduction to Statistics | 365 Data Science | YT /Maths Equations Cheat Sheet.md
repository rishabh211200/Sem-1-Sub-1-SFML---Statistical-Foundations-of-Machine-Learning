# 📑 Math & Stats Cheat Sheet (Story Version)

---

## 🔹 1. Basic Symbols
| Symbol | Name | Story / Meaning |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| x | Variable | A box with some number inside. Example: “x chocolates.” |
| y | Output / Dependent variable | The result that depends on x. |
| k, n | Count / constant | Number of friends, items, samples. |
| = | Equals | Balance scale → both sides same. |

## 🔹 2. Greek Letters You’ll See
| Symbol | Name   | Story / Meaning |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| μ      | Mu     | Mean → “the average score of the group.” |
| σ      | Sigma  | Standard deviation → “how spread out the scores are.” |
| σ²     | Variance | Average squared distance from the mean. |
| α      | Alpha  | Significance level → “risk you’re okay with in testing.” |
| β      | Beta   | Coefficient in regression → “effect of x on y.” |
| λ      | Lambda | Rate → “how often something happens per unit time.” |
| Σ      | Sigma (capital) | Summation → “add everything up.” |

## 🔹 3. Operations
| Symbol | Name | Story / Meaning |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| Σ | Summation | Add many things together. Example: “Total marks of all friends.” |
| ∏ | Product | Multiply many things. |
| √ | Square root | Opposite of squaring (size of one side of a square). |
| \|x\| | Absolute value | Distance from 0, ignoring minus. |

## 🔹 4. Core Equations in Stats/ML
| Equation | Story Version |
|----------|---------------|
| mu = (Σ xi) / n | Mean = add all scores, divide by number of people. |
| sigma^2 = (1/n) Σ (xi - mu)^2 | Variance = check how far each score is from average, square it, add all, divide. |
| z = (x - mu) / sigma | Z-score = “How many steps away from the average is x?” |
| P(A) | Probability of A = chance of A happening (0 to 1). |
| y = mx + c | Straight line: output grows at rate m when x increases, starting at c. |
| y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2... | Regression: output depends on multiple inputs, each with weight (b). |

## 🔹 5. Special Functions
| Symbol | Story |
|--------|-------|
| ∫ f(x) dx | Integration → total area under a curve (like total accumulated value). |
| dy/dx | Derivative → slope/instant speed at a point. |

💡 **How to Use This Sheet:**
- Don’t try to “memorize” — just glance before/after class.  
- Translate each equation into a **story** (scores, chocolates, friends, money).  
- If stuck, ask: *“What is this symbol trying to save me from writing out long-form?”*
