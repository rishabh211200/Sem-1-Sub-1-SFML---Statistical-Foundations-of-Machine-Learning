# 📊 Statistics Terms in Simple English with Real Examples

---

## 🔹 Descriptive Stats (Basic Measures)
| Term | Simple Meaning | Real-Life Example |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| Mean (μ, average) | Add everything and divide by how many | Average marks of your class in an exam |
| Median | Middle value when sorted | Median salary in a company (better than average because of very high CEO pay) |
| Mode | Most frequent value | Most common shoe size sold in a shop |
| Range | Biggest – Smallest | Highest vs lowest cricket score in a tournament |
| Variance (σ²) | How far numbers spread from mean | If everyone in class scored around 70, variance is low; if scores vary 30–95, variance is high |
| Standard Deviation (σ) | Average distance from mean (square root of variance) | If daily temperature usually stays within ±2°C of average, σ=2 |

## 🔹 Probability & Distributions
| Term | Simple Meaning | Real-Life Example |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| Probability (P) | Chance of event (0 to 1) | Probability of rain today is 0.7 → 70% chance |
| Random Variable (X) | A value that changes by chance | Number you get when rolling a dice |
| Distribution | Pattern of how values occur | Bell curve of students’ heights in your class |
| Normal Distribution | Symmetrical bell curve | Human IQ distribution (most people near average, few very high/low) |
| Skewness | Tilt of distribution | Salary data → right-skewed (few very rich people pull avg up) |
| Kurtosis | How “peaked” or “flat” a distribution is | Stock returns (sometimes very sharp peaks due to crashes/booms) |

## 🔹 Sampling & Data
| Term | Simple Meaning | Real-Life Example |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| Population | Entire group you care about | All voters in India |
| Sample | Small subset you study | Survey of 1,000 voters to guess election result |
| Parameter | True measure of population (usually unknown) | Actual average height of all Indians |
| Statistic | Calculated measure from sample | Average height of the 1,000 people surveyed |
| Bias | Systematic error in data | Only surveying rich people to estimate average income |
| Outlier | Extreme value far from others | Student scoring 0 in exam where class average is 70 |

## 🔹 Hypothesis Testing
| Term | Simple Meaning | Real-Life Example |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| Null Hypothesis (H₀) | Default assumption (nothing special happening) | “This new medicine has no effect” |
| Alternative Hypothesis (H₁) | Opposite claim (something is happening) | “This new medicine improves recovery” |
| p-value | Probability of seeing results by chance if H₀ is true | If p=0.01 → only 1% chance results are random noise |
| Significance Level (α) | Threshold you choose for risk (commonly 0.05 = 5%) | If p < 0.05, reject H₀ (you’re okay with 5% error risk) |
| Type I Error (False Positive) | Rejecting H₀ when it’s actually true | Declaring someone has COVID when they don’t |
| Type II Error (False Negative) | Not rejecting H₀ when it’s false | Declaring someone is healthy when they actually have COVID |
| Confidence Interval (CI) | Range where true value likely lies | Poll says candidate’s support = 55% ± 3% (95% CI → real support is between 52–58%) |

---

## 🔹 Correlation & Regression
| Term | Simple Meaning | Real-Life Example |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| Correlation (r) | Strength & direction of relationship (-1 to +1) | More study hours ↔ higher marks (positive correlation) |
| Causation | One thing directly causes the other | Medicine reduces fever (not just correlated, actually causal) |
| Regression | Equation showing how one/more factors affect outcome | Predicting salary using years of experience, education level |
| Coefficient (β) | Impact of each input variable | In regression, β1 = +2000 means each extra year of experience increases salary by ₹2000 |

## 🔹 Advanced but Useful
| Term | Simple Meaning | Real-Life Example |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) | Checks if predictors are too similar (multicollinearity) | If “age” and “experience” overlap too much in regression |
| Entropy | Measure of randomness/disorder | Tossing a fair coin = high entropy, tossing a 2-headed coin = zero entropy |
| Overfitting | Model learns noise instead of pattern | Memorizing past exam answers instead of learning concepts |
| Underfitting | Model too simple to capture data | Predicting everyone’s salary as ₹50k regardless of input |
